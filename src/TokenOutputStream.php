// Provides an output abstraction based on leaf tokens (generated by the lexer) which is aware of their spacing
//  requirements, etc.
// Care must be taken to only introduce whitespace between the nodes which would otherwise change meaning if adjacent
//  (keywords would become identifiers, for example).  We also don't want to gratuitously inject whitespace as that
//  defeats the minification goal of the compiler but can also promote instance variables into keywords ("var", for
//  example).
